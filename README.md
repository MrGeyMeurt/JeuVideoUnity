# SpellCatser
A 3D platformer set in a magical universe where you control a wizard cat that uses its magical grappling hook and spells to navigate treacherous platforms and obstacles.

## Overview
In **SpellCatser**, you play as Mibi the cat, a sorcerer with a magical beam that teleports you across platforms. Your mission is to traverse from one platform to another, avoiding obstacles, until you reach the final platform marked by a flag. Progress through levels—from Level 1 to Level 3—and complete the game by reaching the ultimate destination.  

Inspired by games like *Pseudoregalia*, *Tunic*, and grappling hook mechanics from titles on Steam, SpellCatser offers fast-paced, skill-based gameplay with a touch of magic.

## Game Mechanics
**Teleportation Beam:**  
Mibi fires a magical beam to teleport to a targeted point on a distant platform.  
*Note:* The destination must be within a specific range; otherwise, the teleport will fail.

**Platform Navigation:**  
Move from one platform to the next. If you fall off, you'll respawn at the starting platform of the level.

**Objective:**  
Reach the final platform (with the flag) in each level until you complete Level 3, thereby finishing the game.

## Controls
**Movement:**
- Use either ``ZQSD`` or the ``arrow keys`` to move.

**Pause:**
- Press ``P`` to pause the game.  
*Note:* Future updates may include full gamepad/controller support.
